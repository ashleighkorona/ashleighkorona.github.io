			<h1>PASTA</h1>
			<h4>with baked cherry tomatoes</h4>
			<h6>Serves 6</h6>
				<ol>
					<li>3 pints cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
					<li>1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon</li>
					<li>1⁄3 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta pot</li>
					<li>1⁄4 teaspoon peperoncino flakes, or to taste</li>
					<li>1 pound spaghetti, gemelli, or penne</li>
					<li>10 plump garlic cloves, peeled and sliced</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
					<li>1 cup fresh basil leaves, loosely packed</li>
					<li>1⁄2 cup pecorino, freshly grated, plus more for passing</li>
					<li>4 ounces ricotta, or ricotta salata</li>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<li>Arrange a rack in the center of the oven, and heat to 350 degrees.</li>
					<li>Toss the cherry-tomato halves in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.</li>
					<li>Sprinkle over tomatoes the bread crumbs, salt, and peperoncino; toss well to coat the tomatoes evenly.</li>
					<li>Pour the tomatoes onto the parchment-lined sheet, and spread them apart in a single layer.</li>
					<li>Bake until the tomatoes are shriveled and lightly caramelized (but not dried out), about 25 minutes in all.</li>
					<li>Fill the large pot with salted water, and heat to a rolling boil. When the tomatoes are nearly done, drop the pasta into the pot, stir, and return the water to a boil.</li>
					<li>Pour the remaining olive oil into the big skillet, set it over medium- high heat, and scatter in the sliced garlic as soon as the pasta is cooking.</li>
					<li>Cook for a minute or two, until it is sizzling and lightly colored, then ladle in about 2 cups of the pasta cooking water, and bring to a vigorous boil, stirring up the garlic.</li>
					<li>Let half the water evaporate, then lower the heat, stir in the chopped parsley, and keep the sauce barely simmering.</li>
					<li>Remove them from the oven as soon as the tomatoes are done.</li>
					<li>Lift it from the water, drain for a moment, and drop it into the skillet, still over low heat when the pasta is al dente.</li>
					<li>Toss pasta quickly with the garlic-and- parsley sauce in the pan, then slide the baked tomatoes on top of the pasta.</li>
					<li>Scatter the basil shreds all over, and toss everything together well, until the pasta is evenly dressed and the tomatoes are distributed throughout.</li>
					<li>Turn off the heat, sprinkle on the grated cheese, and toss once more.</li>
					<li>Mound the pasta in a warmed serving bowl.</li>
					<li>Shred the ricotta all over the top, and serve immediately.</li>
