		<p>For this project I was assigned to create a series of postage stamps that celebrated writing and literature. I focused on comic writing, specifically superhero comics, political cartoons, manga, and newspaper comics. Before diving into the thick of it I started this piece with a lot of research. I wanted each stamp to truly connect with not only the writing style but with the graphic style of each type of comic writing.
