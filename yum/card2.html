	<h1>PASTA</h1>
	<h2>with baked cherry tomatoes</h2>
	<h3>Serves 6</h3>
		<ul id="portions">
			<li><span class="amount">3</span>pints cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
			<li><span class="amount">1/2</span>cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon</li>
			<li><span class="amount">1/3</span>cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
			<li><span class="amount">1</span>teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta pot</li>
			<li><span class="amount">1/4</span>teaspoon peperoncino flakes, or to taste</li>
			<li><span class="amount">1</span>pound spaghetti, gemelli, or penne</li>
			<li><span class="amount">10</span>plump garlic cloves, peeled and sliced</li>
			<li><span class="amount">2</span>tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
			<li><span class="amount">1</span>cup fresh basil leaves, loosely packed</li>
			<li><span class="amount">1/2</span>cup pecorino, freshly grated, plus more for passing</li>
			<li><span class="amount">4</span>ounces ricotta, or ricotta salata</li>
		</ul>
		<ul id="instructions">
			<li><span class="action">Arrange</span> a rack in the center of the oven, and heat to 350 degrees.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Toss</span> the cherry-tomato halves in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.</li>
		    <li><span class="action">Sprinkle</span> over tomatoes the bread crumbs, salt, and peperoncino; toss well to coat the tomatoes evenly.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Pour</span> the tomatoes onto the parchment-lined sheet, and spread them apart in a single layer.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Bake</span> until the tomatoes are shriveled and lightly caramelized (but not dried out), about 25 minutes in all.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Fill</span> the large pot with salted water, and heat to a rolling boil. When the tomatoes are nearly done, drop the pasta into the pot, stir, and return the water to a boil.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Pour</span> the remaining olive oil into the big skillet, set it over medium- high heat, and scatter in the sliced garlic as soon as the pasta is cooking.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul id="moreInstructions">
			<li><span class="action">Cook</span> for a minute or two, until it is sizzling and lightly colored, then ladle in about 2 cups of the pasta cooking water, and bring to a vigorous boil, stirring up the garlic.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Let</span> half the water evaporate, then lower the heat, stir in the chopped parsley, and keep the sauce barely simmering.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Remove</span> them from the oven as soon as the tomatoes are done.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Lift</span> it from the water, drain for a moment, and drop it into the skillet, still over low heat when the pasta is al dente.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Toss</span> pasta quickly with the garlic-and- parsley sauce in the pan, then slide the baked tomatoes on top of the pasta.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Scatter</span> the basil shreds all over, and toss everything together well, until the pasta is evenly dressed and the tomatoes are distributed throughout.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Turn</span> off the heat, sprinkle on the grated cheese, and toss once more.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Mound</span> the pasta in a warmed serving bowl.</li>
			<li><span class="action">Shred</span> the ricotta all over the top, and serve immediately.</li>
		</ul>
